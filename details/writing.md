# Improving your academic writing
by Spencer Bryngelson

## Why should I read this?

Many students have trouble producing scientifically-acceptable writing without significant training. (I use “scientifically-acceptable” as a suitcase word for whatever seasoned academics find to be appropriate in journal papers.) Perhaps this isn’t surprising, graduate students do not formally learn how to do this. 

This is juxtaposed by just how important your writing is.
You likely won’t remember many details associated with your past research projects.
Instead, you will use your papers for reference.
Other scientists won’t see your research notes (nor would you want them to) or know the details of your academic past.
Instead, they will first judge you based on your archived writing (conference proceedings and journal articles).
Only few opportunities exist to side-step this.
Giving conference and invited talks communicates your research without paper-in-hand.
However, this format is ephemeral.
Anyone sufficiently interested in your talks will locate your papers to understand your contributions without time constraints.
It is also two-way coupled: you likely won’t find yourself invited to give talks without the presumption of good papers behind them.


Careful writing also begets careful thinking (and vice-versa).
That is, forcing yourself to clarify and organize your work will bring problems in your thinking to light.
For this reason, it can be useful to work on improving your writing as soon as possible.
New graduate students and senior undergraduates may well be 2+ years from starting a manuscript for a journal.
However, they too will benefit from carefully writing up their notes, ideas, and plans.

For the above reasons, high-quality scientific writing is often expected from students ready to graduate with their PhD.
I invite you to use this document to bootstrap your way to scientifically-acceptable technical writing.

## Automatic grammar, spelling, and syntax checkers

Several of these exist.
To my knowledge, the main competitors are [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) and [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/).
Both of these services offer free trials that you can use to see how you like their full services.
I use Grammarly and do not regret the purchase.

These tools can check for simple things, like improper spelling and grammar. 
They can also identify more complicated style-related things, such active and passive voices, repeated words and sentence-starters, "sticky sentences" (run-on sentences held together by many articles), and so on. 

I recommend using one of these before submitting any paper or abstract.
Often even seemingly obvious mistakes can go unnoticed after so many revisions.
Such mistakes are a quick way for an editor or reviewer to perceive your work as not careful (e.g., does he conduct his simulations like he writes his abstracts?!), even if only subconsciously.


## Consistency

One should keep styles consistent within a manuscript.
You might be forgiven for even obviously poor style choices if you are consistent with them throughout.

## Nomenclature

Changing technical terms mid-way through a paper in the name of style will confuse people.
If your domain is a cylinder, don’t switch to “tube” at any point.
If you call your model a "physical model", do not switch to calling it a "numerical model" (with the additional problem that these two things aren't the same, anyway).
If you define your “mesh spacing” in one section, don't switch to "grid spacing" or "mesh resolution" later on.

## Concise writing

One should prefer using as few words as required when describing something technical.
You can consult replacement lists for common mistakes:

* [Wordy phrases](https://grammarist.com/wordiness/)
* [Wordy phrase replacements](https://www.kingcounty.gov/help/editorial-style-guide/concisewriting/wordyphrases.aspx)
* [Wordiness, Wordiness, Wordiness List](https://web.uvic.ca/~gkblank/wordiness.html)
* [50 Plain-Language Substitutions for Wordy Phrases](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/50-plain-language-substitutions-for-wordy-phrases/)

These lists are a way of realizing, "hey, I write wordy phrases like this all the time!".
Use the lists to learn the general ways that one ends up with low information density writing.
You can then identify similar phrases in your own writing.
Often, eliminating them isn't very challenging, but noticing them is (at first).

Conciseness can be viewed in a broader sense.
For example, you should structure your paragraphs such that you aren't repeating information.
