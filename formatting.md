## Why should I read this?

To-do.

## Consistency

One should keep styles consistent within a manuscript. You might be forgiven for even obviously poor style choices if you are consistent with them throughout.

## Figures

Figures should also be consistent, both between each other and with the surrounding text. 
If you use a solid black line to denote the "exact solution" in one figure, do not switch to a dashed red line for a different exact solution in a later figure. 
The fonts used in the figures should match the face and size of the surrounding text. 
Latex uses Computer Modern and Latin Modern font faces and 11pt sizes by default, though journal templates and class files may change this. 

TikZ and PGFplots are TeX packages that provide a natural way to achieve the latter. 
Be warned of the somewhat steep learning curve, though compared to their competitors I think the trade-off is worth it. 
The TeX stack exchange website regularly answers questions about these packages. 
A Google search of most any basic TikZ/PGF question will quickly flag an answer.
