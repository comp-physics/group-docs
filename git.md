# Introduction to git
Written by Jeff Young, modified by Spencer Bryngelson

Revision control serves two purposes for research: 
1. It allows you to easily work on and update code between machines, provides a minimal backup of your codebase, and allows you to work collaboratively with others. 
2. It also allows you to publish your research code, further helping your career and the usage of your software.

## Getting Started with Git
Github has a really good list of resources for learning how to use Git [here](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/).

Of these, I'd suggest starting with Github's [flow guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and 
the [Hello world example](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

I also like the introduction from [Missing Semester.](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)

## Interactive Tutorials

If you'd like to learn via an interactive, online tutorial (before installing git locally), there are two good options for a basic and more intermediate tutorial:

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io): Provides a 15 minute online tutorial including all the basics including adding, commiting, pushing files and handling history and merges.

- [Understanding Git branching](http://learngitbranching.js.org/): This comprehensive tutorial goes through git branching in great detail. Git branching 

## Advanced Git Resources

A researcher at Oak Ridge National Lab, Graham Lopez, has compiled a nice [site](http://www.grahamlopez.net/git) that goes into more details based on his experiences with a large codebase, QMCPack.

## GUI Client Options

While command-line seems to be the best option, especially for development on remote servers, there are several different GUI tools for different OSes listed [here](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/win). Of these, [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (MacOS/Win) and [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) (MacOS/Win) are some of the most well known and are also free. 	

## Other Resources 

[Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)

[Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/): A tutorial that requires you download a git repo but that provides a detailed walkthrough of basic git commands.
