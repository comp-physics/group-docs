# Frequently Asked Questions

This document addresses common questions that students and researchers in our group often have.
If your question isn't answered here, please reach out to Spencer or other members.

## General Questions

### What is the focus of the Computational Physics Group?

Our group focuses on developing computational models and numerical methods for physics problems.
We accompany our methods with algorithms crafted to make efficient use of the latest exascale machines and computer architectures, including AMD GPUs, Arm/RISC CPUs, and quantum computers.
We develop open-source software for these methods that scales to the world's largest supercomputers.
Our work pushes applications forward in areas jet and rocket design, defense broadly, medical therapies and physiology, and the energy sector.

### How do I join the group?

Visit our website at https://comp-physics.group for information about openings.
Messages to Spencer that do not follow the website instructions will be ignored.

## Research and Collaboration

### How are research projects assigned?

Research projects are typically assigned based on a combination of the group's current research priorities, funding availability, your interests, and your skillset.
We try to find a good match between these factors, and there's often room for you to propose your own ideas within our broader research themes.
Our current research includes multiphase flow solvers, stochastic models for cell-scale flow, and information geometric regularization for extreme scale compressible flow simulation.

### How often do we have group meetings?

It ebbs and flows, depending on the interest of the students.

### What software/programming languages should I know?

Proficiency in one high-level and one-level language is important.
We often use Fortran (free-form) as a low-level language, but new projects may be more ammenable to C/C++.
High-level languages are mostly up to you, though I prefer you use Python to maximize the reach of your software.
Our group develops widely used open-source software like MFC, an exascale multi-phase flow solver.

## Academic Progress

### What are the publication expectations?

PhD students generally author or co-author 3-5 papers during the program, with 1 or 2 as first author.
The quality of publications is valued over quantity.
See the [Publishing](publishing.md) guide for more details.
Our group regularly publishes in high-impact journals and conferences in computational physics, fluid dynamics, and related fields.

### How do I know if I'm making good progress in my research?

Feedback should be provided during one-on-one meetings, but if you have any questions or doubts you are *strongly encouraged* to talk to Spencer.
Generally, good progress includes advancing your research questions, developing your technical skills, producing results (even negative ones), working toward publications, and __becoming an independent researcher that does not need Spencer__!
Of course, I understand research has natural ebbs and flows.

## Resources and Support

### What computing resources are available?

Our group has access to various computing resources, like Georgia Tech's PACE cluster and external supercomputing facilities.
See [Available computers](computers.md) for specific information.

### Is there funding for conferences?

Yes, attending conferences is an important part of academic development.
Funding is often available for students.
See [Going to conferences](going-to-conferences.md) for the process of requesting conference funding.

### What should I do if I'm struggling with my research or coursework?

First, know that challenges are normal in research and graduate studies.
Reach out to Spencer for research difficulties or course instructors for academic challenges.

## Work-Life Balance

### What are the expectations for working hours/days?

I value productivity over specific hours worked.
While I expect full-time commitment during normal workweeks for funded students, I'm flexible about when and where you work.
See [When and where of working](when-where-working.md) for more details.

### Can I take vacation time? How much?

Yes, taking breaks is important for maintaining productivity and mental health (at least for most folks).
Typically, students take 2-3 weeks of vacation per year, plus university holidays.
This is flexible, so just talk to Spencer and coordinate with Spencer in advance, especially for longer absences.
You may find yourself taking semi-vacations, where you aren't in town but find yourself doing some side-work for fun anyway.
This is up to you.
