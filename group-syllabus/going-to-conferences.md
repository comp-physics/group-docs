## Going to conferences

__Related documents: [Giving talks](giving-talks.md)__

Most of this goes for undergraduates and graduate students alike.
The "spend authorization" part is only for graduate students.

### Registration, flights, and hotels

I cover all of your conference costs via grant funds.
As such, you will not incur any personal costs for attending a conference for the usual things: registration, flight, hotel, and meals.
If you want to spend money on something else while you are in the conference area, do go for it, though this will be your own expense.

* _Always_ get early bird registration. There is no sense in paying extra money for registration, which already has a high fee.
We know we are attending conferences many months in advance, so there is little excuse not to get the early bird rate. Of course, there are exceptions, and sometimes we decide to attend a conference at the last moment.

* Hotels: For conferences multiple students attend (APS DFD is a typical example), pair up in a two-bed hotel room with someone else. Hotels are getting quite expensive, so this saves a surprising amount of money. If you are uncomfortable rooming with other folks, please let me know. The conference will often offer a special rate for hotels nearby. Sometimes, this is a very good rate, and you should take advantage of it (it will expire once the full hotel block is taken, so be quick). Other times, the hotel rate is similar, and you can book any reasonable hotel near the conference venue.

* Flights: Book your flights reasonably early-at least one month ahead.

* Per diem: You will be reimbursed for your meals via the per diem rate for the conference location.

### Spend authorization

If you are a graduate student employee (on a GRA: Graduate Research Assistantship), you need a spend authorization to be approved by Georgia Tech before going to a conference.
To file a spend authorization, go to [Workday](https://wd5.myworkday.com/gatech/d/home.htmld), use your GT credentials to log in, and type `Create Spend Authorization` in the search bar on the top of the page.
This should take you to a web form to fill out.

An example of how to fill this out
* Start Date: A day before you leave for the conference
* End Date: The day after you return from the conference
* Description: Travel to attend and give a talk at X conference
* Business Purpose: Conference/seminar (should autofill) 

Click `Add` under `Spend Authorization Lines`
* Expense item: `Miscellaneous - Domestic` or `Miscellaneous - International` (depending on if international or not)
* Total amount: about 20% more than your actual planned expenses
* Grant: I will give you a number to copy-paste into here, then link 'Enter,' and it should auto-populate most other fields.

That's it! Ask your colleagues if you have questions. Ask me if they don't know the answer.
