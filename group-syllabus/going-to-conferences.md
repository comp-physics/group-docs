## Going to conferences

### Spend authorization

If you are a graduate student employee (on a GRA, graduate research assistantship), you need a spend authorization to be approved by Georgia Tech before you can go to a conference.
To file a spend authorization, go to [Workday](https://wd5.myworkday.com/gatech/d/home.htmld), use your GT credentials to login, and type 'Create Spend Authorization' in the search bar on the top of the page.
This should take you to a webform to fill out.

An example on how to fill this out
* Start Date: A day before you leave for the conference
* End Date: The day after you return from the conference
* Description: Travel to attend and give a talk at X conference
* Business Purpose: Conference/seminar (should autofill) 

Click 'Add' under 'Spend Authorization Lines'
* Expense item: Miscellaneous - Domestic or Miscellaneous - International (depending on if international or not)
* Total amount: about 20% more than your actual planned expenses
* Grant: I will give you a number to copy-paste into here, then link 'Enter' and it should auto-populate most other fields.

That's it!
