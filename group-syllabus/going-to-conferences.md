## Going to conferences

__Related documents: [Giving talks](giving-talks.md)__

Most of this goes for undergraduates and graduate students alike.
The spend authorization part is only for graduate students.

### Registration, flights, and hotels

I cover all of your conference costs via grant funds.
As such, you will not incur any personal costs for attending a conference for the usual things: registration, flight, hotel, meals.
If you want to spend money on something else while you are in the conference area, do go for it, though this will be your own expense.

* _Always_ get early bird registration. There's no sense in paying extra money for registration, which already has a high fee. We know we are going to conferences many months in advance, so there isn't much excuse to not get the early bird rate. Of course, there are exceptions and sometimes we decide to go to a conference at the last moment.

* Hotels: For conferences that multiple students are going to (APS DFD is a typical example), pair up with someone else in a two-bed hotel room. Hotels are getting quite expensive, so this saves a surprising amount of money. If you are uncomfortable rooming with other folks, please let me know. The conference will often offer a special rate for hotels nearby. Sometimes, this is a very good rate, and you should take advantage of it (it will expire once the full hotel block is taken, so be quick). Other times, the hotel rate is not much better than it would be otherwise, and you can book any reasonable hotel that is nearby the conference venue.

* Flights: Book your flights reasonably early-at least a month ahead of time.

* Per diem: You will be reimbursed for your meals via the per diem rate for the location of the conference.

### Spend authorization

If you are a graduate student employee (on a GRA, graduate research assistantship), you need a spend authorization to be approved by Georgia Tech before you can go to a conference.
To file a spend authorization, go to [Workday](https://wd5.myworkday.com/gatech/d/home.htmld), use your GT credentials to login, and type 'Create Spend Authorization' in the search bar on the top of the page.
This should take you to a web-form to fill out.

An example on how to fill this out
* Start Date: A day before you leave for the conference
* End Date: The day after you return from the conference
* Description: Travel to attend and give a talk at X conference
* Business Purpose: Conference/seminar (should autofill) 

Click `Add` under `Spend Authorization Lines`
* Expense item: `Miscellaneous - Domestic` or `Miscellaneous - International` (depending on if international or not)
* Total amount: about 20% more than your actual planned expenses
* Grant: I will give you a number to copy-paste into here, then link 'Enter' and it should auto-populate most other fields.

That's it! Ask your colleagues if you have questions. Ask me if they don't know the answer.
