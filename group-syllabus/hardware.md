## Whose hardware is this, anyway?

During your Ph.D. or, sometimes, undergraduate work you will acquire hardware that appears to be "from me" to assist with your research.
This hardware is funded by a grant or some other pot of money issued to my research program through the institute.
All work and hardware conducted under the auspices of Georgia Tech is owned by Georgia Tech.
Thus, _you do not own the laptop, workstation, or any other hardware issued to you_ for research purposes (I also do not own it!).
As such, you are required to _return all hardware to Spencer_ upon graduation or when otherwise leaving the research group.
Given this, it is your responsibility to __take care of hardware issued to you, not physically abusing or modifying it__.
It may well be used by someone else in the future.
