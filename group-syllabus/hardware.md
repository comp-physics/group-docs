## Whose hardware is this, anyway?

During your Ph.D. or, sometimes, undergraduate work, you will acquire hardware that appears to be "from me" to assist with your research.
This hardware is funded by a grant or some other money issued to my research program through the institute.
Georgia Tech owns all work and hardware conducted under the auspices of Georgia Tech.
Thus, _you do not own the laptop, workstation, or any other hardware issued to you_ for research purposes (I also do not own it!).
As such, you are required to return all hardware to Spencer upon graduation or when leaving the research group.
Given this, it is your responsibility to __take care of the hardware issued to you, not physically abusing or modifying it__.
It may well be used by someone else in the future.

If you feel uncomfortable being responsible for hardware, like a laptop, that you do not own, please let Spencer know.
