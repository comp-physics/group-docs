## Why should I read this?

Many students have trouble producing scientifically-acceptable writing without significant training.
(I use "scientifically-acceptable" as a suitcase word for whatever seasoned academics find to be appropriate in journal papers.) 
Perhaps this isn't surprising, students do not formally learn how to do this.

This is juxtaposed by just how important your writing is.
You likely won't remember many details associated with your past research projects.
Instead, you will use your papers for reference.
Other scientists won't see your research notes (nor would you want them to) or know the details of your academic past.
Instead, they will first judge you based on your archived writing (conference proceedings and journal articles).
Only few opportunities exist to side-step this.
Giving conference and invited talks communicates your research without paper-in-hand.
However, this format is ephemeral.
Anyone sufficiently interested in your talks will locate your papers to understand your contributions without time constraints.
It is also two-way coupled: you likely won't find yourself invited to give talks without the presumption of good papers behind them.

Careful writing also begets careful thinking (and vice-versa).
That is, forcing yourself to clarify and organize your work will bring problems in your thinking to light.
For this reason, it can be useful to work on improving your writing as soon as possible.
New students may well be over a year from starting a manuscript for a journal.
However, they too will benefit from carefully writing up their notes, ideas, and plans.

For the above reasons, high-quality scientific writing is often expected from students ready to graduate with their PhD.
I invite you to use this document to bootstrap your way to scientifically-acceptable technical writing.

From [this post](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/202685/what-are-some-of-your-pet-peeves-with-academic-writing):
> Ernest Hemingway wrote that "the only kind of writing is rewriting." E. B. White wrote essentially the same thing: "The best writing is rewriting."
> 
> I have plenty of pet peeves about academic writing, but they all seem to have the same cause: that the author apparently didn't care about writing well.
> 
> Your first version of anything is likely to be mediocre. (That's certainly true for me!) Care about your own writing, enough to notice and be annoyed by shortcomings in your first draft, and then figure out how to improve it. Do this, and you will be well on your way to excellent writing.

## Automatic grammar, spelling, and syntax checkers

Several of these exist.
To my knowledge, the main competitors are [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) and [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/).
Both of these services offer free trials that you can use to see how you like their full services.
I use Grammarly and do not regret the purchase.

These tools can check for simple things, like improper spelling and grammar. 
They can also identify more complicated style-related things, such active and passive voices, repeated words and sentence-starters, "sticky sentences" (run-on sentences held together by many articles), and so on. 

I recommend using one of these before submitting any paper or abstract.
Often even seemingly obvious mistakes can go unnoticed after so many revisions.
Such mistakes are a quick way for an editor or reviewer to perceive your work as not careful (e.g., does he conduct his simulations like he writes his abstracts?!), even if only subconsciously.

## Consistency

One should keep styles consistent within a manuscript.
You might be forgiven for even obviously poor style choices if you are consistent with them throughout.
Please see the [these](formatting.md) documents for more on this.

## Nomenclature

Changing technical terms mid-way through a paper in the name of style will confuse people.
If your domain is a cylinder, don't switch to "tube" at any point.
If you call your model a "physical model", do not switch to calling it a "numerical model" (with the additional problem that these two things aren't the same, anyway).
If you define your “mesh spacing” in one section, don't switch to "grid spacing" or "mesh resolution" later on.

## Concise writing

One should prefer using as few words as required when describing something technical.
You can consult replacement lists for common mistakes:

* [Wordy phrases](https://grammarist.com/wordiness/)
* [Wordy phrase replacements](https://www.kingcounty.gov/help/editorial-style-guide/concisewriting/wordyphrases.aspx)
* [Wordiness, Wordiness, Wordiness List](https://web.uvic.ca/~gkblank/wordiness.html)
* [50 Plain-Language Substitutions for Wordy Phrases](https://www.dailywritingtips.com/50-plain-language-substitutions-for-wordy-phrases/)

These lists are a way of realizing, "hey, I write wordy phrases like this all the time!".
Use the lists to learn the general ways that one ends up with low information density writing.
You can then identify similar phrases in your own writing.
Often, eliminating them isn't very challenging, but noticing them is (at first).

Conciseness can be viewed in a broader sense.
For example, you should structure your paragraphs such that you aren't repeating information.

## More tips

From [some tips for scientific writing](https://kucharski.substack.com/p/some-tips-for-scientific-writing).

* Use the "show don't tell" technique. If something is interesting or surprising, the reader should be interested or surprised by what they've read. They shouldn't need to be told. Anton Chekhov reportedly said: "Don't tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on broken glass".

* Don't bury the lede. When journalists write articles, they usually put the crucial information in the 'lede' opening paragraph. Hiding big news later in the piece is known as "burying the lede". This idiom forms part of the inverted pyramid approach to writing: put the most important information first in an article or section, then fill out the details.

* Read widely, reflecting as you go. Why was that sentence hard to follow? Why did you like that section of text? Why was that turn of phrase annoying? What gave that paragraph its nice balance and rhythm? As Toni Morrison once put it: "Writing is really a way of thinking – not just feeling but thinking about things that are disparate, unresolved, mysterious, problematic or just sweet."

* Make your reader care about what they're reading. Like a good story, that typically means outlining a clear problem, with the promise of a later resolution.

* The analysis wasn't done by some anonymous entity. You did the analysis. So avoid the passive voice if possible. (See also: "a decision was made" rather than "we made the decision" when it comes to responsibility-dodging in leadership messages.)

* If you promise something in the introduction, make sure you've delivered by the end of the results. For example, if you open by mentioning A and B, readers will be expecting a conclusion about A and B by the end of the paper. "Remove everything that has no relevance to the story,' as Chekhov put it. "If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off."

* Follow Orwell's rules of writing
    * Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
    * Never use a long word where a short one will do.
    If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
    * Never use the passive where you can use the active.
    * Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
    * Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

* Kill your darlings. Sometimes you'll write a phrase that is so elegant and so well crafted, it jars with the rest of your writing and pulls the reader out of the flow. So cut it. As Stephen King once put it: _'Kill your darlings, kill your darlings, even when it breaks your egocentric little scribbler's heart, kill your darlings.'_

* If you want to describe a figure/table in the results text, it can help to imagine you're giving a seminar. What features would you draw your audience's attention to? What would you tell people about in the coffee break?

* Help the reader interpret your figures and tables. Don't give them a sixteen panel graph and expect them to spot the main takeaway; if the author can't be bothered to find a key message, the reader almost certaintly won't either.

* You can probably cut about half your word count if you really need to do, without losing your meaning. (I've managed to cut down a bunch of paper submissions into much shorter report formats when really pressed.)

* A good intro and discussion will often include a reference or statistic most readers won't have been aware of. Try and find the best references, rather than the easiest ones.
