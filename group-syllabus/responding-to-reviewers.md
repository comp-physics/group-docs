## Responding to reviewers

When you submit a paper, you will likely get reviews back that request changes to your work.
These changes may be fundamental and major, or minor and relatively easy to respond to.
Sometimes the best papers require the most major changes, because they are high impact or the reviewer is just very picky.
Further, sometimes the reviewer may not fully appreciate what you were writing about, and so the questions don't make so much sense.
You should be prepared for all such situations.
In the end, it is up to you to make your contributions crystal clear and tell and complete story that is accessible to __your audience__.
I cannot stress that last sentence enough.

### Principle of charity

While you may want to be defensive of your work, thinking something like "this reviewer didn't even read the paper!", I recommend taking a more balanced approach.
If they didn't read your paper deeply and comprehensively, why not?
It could be because it did not grab their interest quickly, and the objective of the paper was evasive to them.
In such cases, it is very easy to be lazy when it comes to reviewing.
In the end, reviewing papers is an unpaid service that we do as academics, for better or worse.
So, if a paper is boring or otherwise doesn't grab the reviewer's attention, they may quickly dismiss much of the paper and only skim it (if that!).

Again, _it is your responsibility to make the paper interesting, clear, and appear important to the reviewer_.

If they only skim it, their critiques of your work may not make much sense to you.
In these cases, you should respond charitably, and point the reviewer to the part of the paper that does describe what you did clearly.
You likely will want to reword certain parts of the paper so that you can say something like
> Indeed X was not clear, though was discussed in Section Y.Z. We have rephrased and clarified paragraph A of this section to make point B more clear. Below is the revised text:

### Knowing what to and not to do

Sometimes a reviewer will request you to do significant extra work for a paper.
Whether or not you should do this rests on many choices.
Does the extra work _really_ improve the paper or make your conclusions more salient or obvious?
If it doesn't, you should elide doing this extra work as it (a) doesn't meaningfully improve the paper and thus (b) wastes your time and (c) the reader's time.
In the end, this is a rather sensitive topic and one has to be careful with wording.
I will help you decide what should and shouldn't do.
Regardless, you should be very grateful for the reviewer's contributions in helping create a better manuscript.

### Examples

There is an example revision template in [../templates/paper_rebuttal], along with a `Makefile` that uses the `latexdiff` tool to create a `diff` between the submitted and revised manuscript.
I am also including example revisions there.
