### The What and Why of a Ph.D.

Advising and working with Ph.D. students is the *best part of my job*.
In fact, it is probably the main reason I chose to be a professor.
Ph.D. students are my most central and essential collaborators.
The two main goals of my work with Ph.D. students are (1) to produce great research and advance the world's knowledge, and (2) to advise and train the student to become independent, knowledgeable, critical, and capable researchers.

The main requirement for your Ph.D. is to be passionate about scientific inquiry, pursuing research ideas and questions, and being willing to develop the methodological depth and expertise to address these ideas in the most robust-yet-attainable manner.

This is also *your* Ph.D., so:

- You should have significant freedom and agency.
- You should feel ownership over your research.
- You should be excited about the research you do.

By contrast, I don't believe the Ph.D. is:

- A "long class"
- A program where I hand you a list of instructions for you to carry out
- A way for me to extract labor to grow my CV
- A way for you to boost your CV to get a job of <type X>  (for any X, e.g., "professor")

Toward these ends, I will aim to give you as much independence as I think you can handle (and maybe a little more), as early as you can and want to have it.
I try to assess this on a case-by-case basis; if you feel like I misjudged it any time (e.g., too much or too little), please let me know.
The general path is increasing independence with increasing time.

### How long is a Ph.D.?

I believe that your Ph.D. is over when you:

1. Have satisfied the minimum requirements of the program
2. Have made significant academic contributions
3. Can get the job you want.

The Ph.D. tends to take about _very roughly_ 4-7 years; typical is 5, and students headed to the academic job market leaning towards 5-6. 
However, your work ethic, project(s), and more can shorten or lengthen this.
