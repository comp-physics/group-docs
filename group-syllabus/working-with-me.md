## Working with Me

The advisor-advisee relationship represents a significant responsibility and commitment on both our parts.
I attempt to hold myself to high standards with students, but I also have high expectations from students who work with me.
We should all be responsive, respectful, honest, timely, and hard-working.
When those things aren't happening, we should talk to figure out how we can get there.
Note that the failure, or perceived failure, could also be due to my actions.
I recognize that this is one of the most important and consequential relationships you will have; while I hope it will be at least as meaningful for me, it is less likely to be as consequential.
As a result, I encourage you to let me know if something needs to be fixed.

Importantly, I am your _advisor_, not your manager, supervisor, or even your teacher.
I am not here to "boss you around" or to tell you what to do when, but I do provide suggestions, recommendations, and sometimes even decisions ("this paper is not good enough to submit for this deadline"), and I do expect to see various outcomes (and progress). 
But, I try to stay away from prescribing the details.
Instead, I will help you set your plans and goals and the best way to reach them.
Of course, the power dynamics are somewhat tilted in my "favor," and I recognize that. 
I often fund your work, I sign your thesis, I report to the school on your progress, and more.
Still, I welcome pushback from Ph.D. students (e.g., "I don't think we should run this simulation"), as well as healthy feedback and disagreement.
A relationship where we never disagree is unlikely to be a fruitful one. 
If you are taking agency over your work, you will eventually feel that one of my suggestions could be better, and I encourage you to tell me.

I also am unlikely to directly teach you the specific skills you need for your research tasks.
I will not teach you Fortran or C++ (or any other programming language).
I will not teach you how to launch an ssh session onto one of the university supercomputers.
I _will_ help you get all these skills, though, by pointing you to the right resources when needed (e.g., courses, papers, tutorials, documentation, or knowledgeable others).

### Power Structures

The university has strong hierarchical structures.
Professors are in positions of power over students, and students, unfortunately, cannot always speak up when something isn't right.
I welcome student input, especially if I or one of my colleagues has said or done something that makes a student feel uncomfortable.
I realize it is a difficult proposition in many cases, especially if you feel I am the culprit.
If you feel you suffered an injustice, I encourage you to speak to me or other trusted individuals.

### Co-advising

I am a fan of co-advising Ph.D. students, and many of my students are, or have, been co-advised.
As long as the "trio" dynamics are healthy, including the relationship between the two advisors, this is a good idea: it gives you another person to advise you and be invested in your future; it broadens the ideas and knowledge you are exposed to.
There are potential drawbacks, some overhead for you (scheduling, more weekly and lab meetings), and potential friction when advisors disagree.
But overall, if there are two faculty members whose work, vision, and interests align with yours, you should explore co-advising.

### Time with me and Others

I prioritize my time to maximize availability to talk research with students.
Still, there are sometimes other requirements on my time, often immutable and sometimes urgent.
You should expect to be able to see me often or get fairly rapid responses, but do not expect to see me or be able to get my time and attention "on demand."
You are always welcome to try, though!

Most importantly, we will have a 45-60-minute weekly one-on-one meeting slot to discuss your work and progress, brainstorm ideas, and discuss any matter you want.
Please feel free to ask for my time at any other point, e.g., for a quick ad-hoc meeting, which I will be happy to do whenever possible.

Beyond the 1-1 meeting, you will be asked to attend the weekly group meeting where students share progress and other updates.
You may also see me in project-specific meetings (frequency depends on the project) when we work with other collaborators.

### How to get a hold of me

Our group Slack workspace is the best way to find me if I'm not in my office.

__Note:__ If you want me to be responsive to you, you should be responsive to me.
However, I do not expect you to be responsive during non-standard working hours (unless we agreed to be working on a deadline).
