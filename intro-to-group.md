# Welcome to the Computational Physics @ GT CSE research group!

We are happy to have you (you wouldn't be reading this, otherwise).

## Getting started 

### CODA

You will need access to the CODA building.
GT CSE is on floor 13, and our group is in room S1347.
We also hold meetings either in my office (S1313) or one of the conference rooms on this floor.
Request this from Spencer. 
Send him your GTID number, it will likely take about a week to "start working," though times vary.

### Websites and software

* Box, located [here](https://gatech.app.box.com/folder/142416587982)
    * Purpose: Common location to store stuff, unlimited space, put your group and 1-1 updates here.
    * Request access to group Box from Spencer.

* GitHub organization, located [here](https://github.com/comp-physics)
    * Purpose: Your code goes here. Keep it up-to-date via commits. I will likely bug you if you don't keep your codes updated via regular commits as you make progress.
    * Request access from Spencer.

* Zotero, located [here](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4507615/comp-physics/library)
    * We have an unlimited shared Zotero group, where you should place papers and books relevant to your studies. I also reference many different texts at random times, and you can often find them available here. 
    * It has an iPhone app, a MacOS/*nix app, a web interface, etc. Very convenient. I prefer over Mendeley after using both significantly.
    * Request access from Spencer.

### Computers

We maintain access to many (super)computers and testbeds.
We maintain a separate page on this [here](computers.md)

## Research meetings

You will usually have a meeting with Spencer every week (often on Monday). 
These sometimes involve you and another student (2-1 meetings).
During this meeting you will present an update on your research.
We also have an in-person group meeting every week.
Some guidelines apply:
* Have at least one PowerPoint slide for each update, stating the work you did and plan to do in the next week (see examples in the Box `updates/` directory).
* If you have little progress, that's OK! In fact, the weeks you have the least progress are the most important for updates, since my job (in part) is to help you.
* Even if you have little progress because you were busy with coursework or on a vacation, please put this on a slide so I can keep track of things.

## Group GitHub Page

We have a [group GitHub page](https://github.com/comp-physics).
You should keep the software projects related to your research in repositories on this page.
We keep all of our software public (open-source), even during development.
We often use the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), which is permissive and copyleft.
It also allows us to collaborate freely with corporations, like those at NVIDIA and Google, as well as our academic and lab-based partners.

## Collaboration

You are expected to collaborate with your colleagues when appropriate. 
Your colleagues are students within the group and the school more broadly.
Part of this is willingly and openly sharing your [code](https://opensource.google/docs/why/) and [ideas](https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_come_from?language=en).
It makes us all better researchers.

## Social activities

We try to arrange a group social activity at least every few months. 
This means things like going to a neighborhood restaurant or a trivia night, but we do an anonymous poll to see what everyone would enjoy.
