# Welcome to the Computational Physics @ GT research group!

We are happy to have you (you wouldn't be reading this, otherwise).

## Research meetings

You will usually have a meeting with Spencer every week. 
These sometimes involve you and and another student.
During this meeting you will present an update on your research.

## Group Github Page

We have a [group Github page](https://github.com/comp-physics).
You should keep the software projects related to your research in repositories on this page.
We keep all of our software public (open-source), even during development.
We use the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), which allows the re-use and modification of software without our permission.
It is worthwhile to learn how to properly use `git`. 
A separate page for that is here (to be filled).

## Collaboration

You are expected to collaborate with your colleagues when appropriate. 
Your colleages are students within the group and the school more broadly.
Part of this is willingly and openly sharing your [code](https://opensource.google/docs/why/) and [ideas](https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_johnson_where_good_ideas_come_from?language=en).
It makes us all better researchers.

## Social activities

We try to arrange a group social activity at least every few months. 
This means things like going to a neighborhood restaurant or a trivia night, but we do an anonymous poll to see what everyone would enjoy!
