### Challenges and Mental Health

The PhD experience can be very challengingâ€”and in unexpected ways.
It is common to experience mental health challenges during grad school.
While I'm not personally trained to help directly, I hope to be supportive in whatever ways my advisees feel will be helpful, including of course helping them avoid such issues wherever I can.
I have met very few individuals that have not struggled with anxiety and other mental issues during their PhD.
There are many reasons for that, in my opinion, mostly due to the combination of uncertainty, self-responsibility, and relentless feedback one receives as a PhD student.
It is possible that you will experience some anxiety during your PhD, most likely during your 2-3rd year where your self-expectations are high, and feedback in the form of recognized success or established dissertation direction are still often somewhat elusive.
This feeling is common, and many PhD students will experience it at some point or another.
Don't be alarmed; come to talk to me (or others) if you feel that way.

The environment in academia, including at Georgia Tech, will not stop you from overworking at the cost of your well-being.
Quite the opposite, you will often feel like academic work culture encourages working evenings and weekends, and many do (I do).
However, overworking is neither healthy nor productive in the long run as a PhD is a marathon, not a sprint.
When you feel uneasy, don't run faster, but keep good company.
After all, the point of a PhD program is that you don't need to run it all alone.
