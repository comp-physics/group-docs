### Funding

Your PhD comes with guaranteed funding (i.e., stipend, tuition, health insurance) as long as you are in "good standing" according to the departments' annual review, which generally tends to mean "while you are in the program".
This means you are guaranteed to have a fellowship, Graduate Research Assistantship (RA), or Teaching Assistantship (TA) to support you throughout your time at Georgia Tech. 

#### Research and Teaching Asssistantship 

It is my role to make sure that you are supported by an RA or fellowship for as much as your PhD as possible.
Your PhD program will require some (typically two) semesters of TA during your PhD, and you may be asked to do more of them.

RAs generally means some sort of grant, gift, or research award supports your work.
Again it is my role to raise this money to support your research, or to fit your research into funding that I already have.
It is also possible that later in the PhD I will ask you (or you will initiate) for your help in writing a grant proposal in your area.
This is good practice for you as a future academic.
 
TAs represent a certain, bounded amount of work in terms of hours per week.
Your PhD work should be filling the rest of your working hours.

#### Fellowships

I expect you to apply for appropriate fellowships during your PhD.
Such fellowships include for example the NSF Graduate Fellowship, or corporate fellowships like Microsoftâ€™s.
Usually these applications are not too much work, and as a side benefit require you to articulate your research vision and interests.
When you get one, everyone benefits: you are more flexible in your work to pursue your research direction without the pull of funding needs; I spend more time with you and less time getting grants; and you get a recognition that goes on your CV.
 
#### Stipend

Your stipend is determined by the Graduate School at Georgia Tech.
The PhD stipend is by no means a lot of money, but I believe people have found that it supports a comfortable life that allows you to focus on your studies.
On a related note, there is an expectation that your PhD will be your full-time work, though internships are possible and even recommended.
