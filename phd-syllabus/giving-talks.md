### Giving talks

I've never liked giving talks.
I now think academics overfit to the performative aspects of them.
Despite that, talks are important.
Many (most?) academics disagree with me: they like giving talks, and highly value talks given by other academics.
For example, it's common wisdom that many professors on the faculty you join will only know about your work through your job talk.

The guidance I usually give around talks is somewhat traditional: 1) plan and 2) practice.
First, I write down what I want the audience to learn from the talk.
Then, I look at the time I have available to speak and subtract 5 minutes.
From that number, I break down how much time I want to spend on the different parts of the talk.
After those two things, I start building slides (and maybe demos).

After you have a deck, I recommend practicing the talk a few times by yourself.
Especially early in your PhD, you should then plan on giving at least two practice talks to an audience (one of them with me).
Later, you won’t need as much practice for a conference talk, let’s say; but a job talk may require even more practice and iteration.
After you synthesize and iterate on all the feedback, you’re ready to go.
This process often takes many days, even for a short talk.

#### Q&A

After you give a talk, there will usually be Q&A.
I like to think of it as having a discussion with a colleague—in front of a large audience.
That’s the tone I’m aiming for in my answers to questions.
Three concrete tips:

1. Remember that you almost certainly know more about the details of your work more than anyone else in the room.

2. If I'm in any way unsure what the questioner is asking, I make sure I understand it before I start answering.
Typically, I will restate the question in my own words and ask if that’s what they meant.
This gives them an opportunity to correct and reword.
An interesting side effect is that it also gives me a few more seconds to think about a possible answer.
This is an even better trick if English is not your first language.

3. It is okay to take a second or two to think before you start talking.
After all, the asker has been sitting there for 15 minutes considering the question; you only just heard it!
And after all that, it's completely okay to say you're not sure, and that you need to think about it harder, and get back to them later.
I have done this many times during Q&A.
