### Giving talks

Talks are important: They show your command of your research and your ability to stitch together a story worth listening to.
Most professors will agree that the new faculty hired into the school are judged primarily on their job talk.

The guidance I usually give around talks is somewhat traditional: 1) plan and 2) practice.
First, I write down what I want the audience to learn from the talk.
Then, I look at the time I have available to speak and subtract 5 minutes.
From that number, I break down how much time I want to spend on the different parts of the talk.
After those two things, I start building slides.

After you have a deck, practice the talk by yourself: Pull up your slides and start going through the talk aloud on your laptop with no one else around. 
Fortunately, the talks you're likely to give early in your academic career are also the shortest.
This means you can practice them, in their entirety, a dozen times within an hour or two.
I guarantee that a talk practiced front-to-back 12 times will be delivered more cleanly than one never practiced, and everyone in the room can tell the difference.
If I'm nervous about a talk on a new topic, I sometimes practice even more than this. 

Especially early in your PhD, you should then plan on giving at least two practice talks to an audience (one of them with me).
Later, you won’t need as much practice for a conference talk, let’s say; but a job talk may require even more practice and iteration.
After you synthesize and iterate on all the feedback, you’re ready to go.
This process often takes many days, even for a short talk.

The most common feedback I give on talks is:
* The talk was not structured for the audience. 
  * Who are you talking to? It matters! In fact, it might be the thing that matters most.
* What was your message? 
  *  If the message is unclear to me, it will definitely be unclear to others. If your talk doesn't have a message, consider why, come up with an appropriate one, and restructure your slides.
* You did not practice enough. 
  *  You know your talk is well practiced when you can deliver it without looking at the slides/projector most of the time. Why? Because you already know what's on them, and what's coming next! This allows you to engage with the audience. 
  *  You know your talk is not well-practiced when you are reading the slides: I, too, can read your slides. If that's what you were going to do, you could have just sent a PDF of the slides to the audience to peruse at their own leisure.
*  Stop using superlatives.
    *  Words like _very_ can pollute an otherwise excellent talk. "The relationship is _very_ complicated." "This equation is _very_ nonlinear." What does one intend with such words? Best case: People think you have a nervous tick. Worst case: People think you are trying to make your work seem artificially interesting and challenging. We all work on hard things.


#### Q&A

After you give a talk, there will usually be Q&A.
I like to think of it as having a discussion with a colleague—in front of a large audience.
That’s the tone I’m aiming for in my answers to questions.
Three concrete tips:

1. Remember that you almost certainly know more about the details of your work more than anyone else in the room.

2. If I'm in any way unsure what the questioner is asking, I make sure I understand it before I start answering.
Typically, I will restate the question in my own words and ask if that’s what they meant.
This gives them an opportunity to correct and reword.
An interesting side effect is that it also gives me a few more seconds to think about a possible answer.
This is an even better trick if English is not your first language.

3. It is okay to take a second or two to think before you start talking.
After all, the asker has been sitting there for 15 minutes considering the question; you only just heard it!
And after all that, it's completely okay to say you're not sure, and that you need to think about it harder, and get back to them later.
I have done this many times during Q&A.
