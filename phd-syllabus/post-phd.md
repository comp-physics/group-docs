### Post-PhD

Where could you expect to end up after your PhD? Well, the sample so far is not very large so it is hard to generalize and predict. Students I have advised have ended up in both academia and industry positions. Some typical targets are academic positions (often after a post-doc appointment), industry research, data scientist roles, software/ML engineering, and user experience research roles. 

At some point in your PhD, typically after 3-4 years though sometimes earlier (and sometimes later), we will have a better idea of which careers you may desire and which may be attainable. When that happens, we will work together to align your work, output, and activities to maximize the likelihood of the desired outcome.
