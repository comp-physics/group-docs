### Doing Research

The most important thing you do in graduate school is your own research.
It may seem obvious, but it’s easy to lose track of the importance of your own research amid all the other competing things you’ll be asked to do in grad school: take classes, review papers, help teach a class, run a working committee, organize various activities, etc.
Some of these will be fun; many of them will feel more important at the time than making (what may seem like limited) progress on your research.

#### Selecting problems

I advise students to aspire for impact in their work.
Not by accident, this is also what I hope for in my work (which of course intersects and overlaps with your work).
It's important to have impact in mind when you approach problems (that is, before you select and commit your time to them).
Some guidelines on impact might include:

**What difference will this work make if you succeed?** 
- Whose lives will be made better by this research?
- How will this improve upon what’s currently being done?
- Why is this one of the most important questions in the field?
- Will it create a big policy change at some level (company, government)?
- Will it inspire a new class of systems?

**Who will care about it when you’re done?**
- Will government agencies care?
- Will platforms and industry care?
- Will other academics care enough to cite it?
- Will other academics care enough to teach it to their students?
- Will anyone care about it 10, 20, 50 years in the future?

**How will this change what other people (defined broadly) are doing?**
- Will other researchers change what they’re working on after seeing your work?
- Will practitioners do something different?
- Will users adopt what you’ve made, found, created?
- Will regulators use what you’ve found to draft new laws?

Eric Gilbert recommends [Hamming’s lecture on this topic](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) which one day I will read and endorse here more directly (or not).

#### Discipline, Methods, and Contributions

I am a professor of Information Science at Cornell, as well as a field member in Computer Science.
This means I can be the main advisor for PhD students in both these programs.

Having said that, especially in Information Science, the type of contributions you make and the type of methods you might use vary significantly.
I don’t like labels, but if I had to align myself with one research paradigm, I would point at pragmatism which is “based on the proposition that researchers should use the philosophical and/or methodological approach that works best for the particular research problem that is being investigated” (Kaushik and Walsh 2019).

As such, my students end up doing work that ranges from qualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews, to quantitative methods like online experiments and large-scale data collection and analysis, to computational methods such as system building and evaluation as well as developing computational techniques based on machine learning or algorithms of various types.
Very often, it is the same student that applies more than one of these methods for their PhD work.

### Expected Output

See [Eric's syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11D3kHElzS2HQxTwPqcaTnU5HCJ8WGE5brTXI4KLf4dM/edit#) for an important discussion of quality versus quantity.

This is a note about what you should _strive_ to achieve in terms of output during your PhD.
This is not necessarily what I expect to see as your output -- but what you should expect to _try_ to produce.
These expectations are also averaged over multiple years.
You should expect to produce less in your first and second years (for example, it's ok to have only one project to begin with, possibly through a collaboration with a senior student), and more in your third and fourth (often dropping again in the final year while you are searching for jobs).

1. Try to produce one very high-quality, high-risk paper per year.
This should yield 3-4 actually published versions of these, on average, over the span of your PhD.
Some of these papers won’t get in somewhere competitive, or may simply not work out well into the research process (e.g., approach didn’t work, context of the problem changed, etc.).
That’s the nature of research work like this.
This is the most important type of output you might produce in your PhD.

2. Concurrently, try to have a straightforward project underway.
This is the lower-risk, lower-reward paper.
1.5 of these every 2 years seems like about the right fit (i.e., slightly less than one of these projects ongoing, per year).
More of these should get published, and fewer of them will fall apart along the way.
That’s the nature of this work.
This might be in collaboration with a larger group, but you should play a significant role.
This is important for your sense of progress, as the more challenging work might stall and frustrate.
This is also important to get exposure for you and your ideas in a wider set of venues.

3. Concurrently, try to be a supporting author on at least one other project.
This isn’t your core work: it’s being led by someone else.
It should take less than ½-⅓ of a day of your time per week.
But you have something to offer, and expect to be listed in a supporting author position.
Also of the lower-risk, lower-reward variety.
This type of contribution is important for you to become known (even locally) for your expertise; improve collaboration skills, and in general contribute to your immediate academic community.

Note that if all of these are going on, and with other tasks and roles you will be taking, you are likely to have your plate feel very full.
You will need to make sure you balance your time, and not forget to take time off (more of these considerations below).

### Staying organized

I don’t like to dictate how anyone works.
But in general it’s very useful for me to keep track of my research work in an intentional way.
I make heavy use of cloud services for documents, code, data, etc.; I've seen many others use Git repositories to do similar things (which may work best if you want to track versions of a Jupyter notebook, let’s say).
I often keep a little text file in any project directory that holds the state of the project, should I need to go away from it and come back to it later.
Pick what works best for you, but the advice I would give is to do something intentional from the outset of a project.

Also, **BACKUP.** Your research work should never live solely on any single hard drive.


### Research Ideas and Directions

_Have ideas!_

Seriously, I do not like supervising a student without their own ideas—nor do I think it’s good for your development as a scholar.
As noted above, the major thing that we’re doing here is turning you into a world-class scholar.
One key way you do that is by coming up with new ideas.
Moreover, it’s important for being competitive in academic job applications; those evaluations are impacted by your future work ideas, not only your work to date.

Good ideas are rare and are hard to come by.
Most of my ideas, which you can expect to hear plenty of, are bad (memorable quote from a student to me during their Cornell A (qualifying) Exam: "this is _actually_ not a bad idea!").
I love to hear ideas, good or bad -- some might turn out to be the opposite after a short (or long) discussion.
Ideas are everywhere, and if you let yourself, you’ll have them all time.
It can be easy in graduate school to find yourself submerged in the details of ongoing projects constantly, without popping up to think about and consider new projects, ideas, and directions.
Both are important: a good scholar can move between levels of detail (i.e., “What’s the right statistical technique for these data in this paper?” to “Which of these 5 new ideas would have the most impact?”).

#### Where to find ideas

Some concrete ways in which one might find good ideas:

* More commonly, remember that we stand on the shoulders of giants.
When you read a good paper -- really, any paper -- think about how components of that paper could apply to your own research.
For example, the methods the authors used; the way they ask their research questions; or the type of analysis they perform; or even how they present their results can all provide key insights.

* When you read a good paper in your own research area, ask yourself what should come next.
What assumptions do they make?
What would make this even better?
What are the authors missing that is not an immediate "future work"  for that  scholar’s arc?
Identifying papers like that can have an impact on your research directions over time.

* A lot of the phenomena we see online and around technology are not, strictly speaking, new.
Many of them have been thought about and studied in earlier forms.
Try to read broadly (e.g., sociology, social psychology, communication, economics, etc.), and consider how these texts and concepts are related to your work.

I recommend finding a good way to keep track of ideas.
Eric [reports](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11D3kHElzS2HQxTwPqcaTnU5HCJ8WGE5brTXI4KLf4dM/edit#) using a file called “ideas.txt” where he adds new ideas as they come to mind.
I use Evernote, using a note for each new idea with the searchable text "research idea".
A research notebook (note: use a Moleskine for the "I know what I'm doing" look) is another way to keep track, although it's perhaps not as easily searchable.

Importantly, while there is no such thing as "too many ideas", you shouldn't pursue more than a few at a time, and carefully balance new ideas with ongoing work.
Which brings us to...

#### Deciding on Ideas to Pursue

I am often asked who decides which ideas and research direction to pursue.
Can a PhD student choose any topic and research direction?
Do I dictate research agendas and projects to the student?
The reality is that we decide together on which ideas and directions to work on.
It's an iterative, long term process that results in the alignment.
It starts when students pick to work with me -- and I with them -- because we have a shared interest.
I am likely to steer new students towards directions and questions that I think are interesting (sometimes new, sometimes existing), especially projects which I have funding to work on.
But I never "assign" projects -- if the student is not excited and motivated about a research direction, the outcome is not likely to be good.
Similarly, students can pursue a project that I am less interested in, but that results in me being less engaged and less helpful as an advisor.
The process of coming up with ideas, research questions, and project decisions thus naturally gravitates towards mutually interesting directions that overlap with existing or potential funding.

At the same time, "interest splits" happen, and students often pursue questions and directions.
If there's no overlap, one option is to switch advisors.
I have had students leave me to work with other advisors as it became clear that their pursuit and intellectual passion does not overlap with mine (two come to mind in recent years; both have done well after the switch, and our personal relationship was never jeopardized, although you should ask them if they feel the same way -- I think they do).
