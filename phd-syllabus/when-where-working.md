### The Where and When of Working

One of the biggest challenges in your PhD is time management.
I will help you set long-term and short-term goals, but will never directly manage your time or your tasks.
As a result, you will be the prime owner of your time and schedule -- for better or worse!

I highly recommend that you structure your time in some way that works for you.
For example, I believe that it will be helpful to you to work on research everyday: structures and routines can help you accomplish that, rather than frenzied effort right before deadlines.

At a high level, you should have a set of daily tasks, but also some higher level (weeks, month, semester, year) goals.
I will help you set those, typically going to larger and larger time frames as your PhD advances.
For time and task management, use whatever tool works for you: notebooks, task manager apps, text files, etc., but make sure to use _something_.

#### Work location

We work in CODA, which has an open space layout where my students sit near each other.
You will have an assigned desk in that space.
I spend most of my time at my office, which is near that space.
I expect most students to be working from that space regularly, which is not to say "most of the time", but perhaps a substantial portion of the working hours each week in that space.
Most of the students come in at least 3 days a week.
Frankly, if work and progress gets done I don't mind where you are.
**But I find that progress and problem solving are more likely when you are surrounded by others (including me) who can help solve problems, answer questions, and point you in a helpful direction.**
This is in addition to providing an environment that helps you focus on work.
It's often the case that students vary their physical presence, e.g.,
when they have a writing task that requires focus not offered in a more busy environment.
That's totally acceptable, but you are expected to let the team (me, your collaborators) know when they should expect you.
