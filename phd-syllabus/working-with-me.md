### Working with Me

The advisor-advisee relationship represents a significant responsibility and commitment on both our parts.
I try to hold myself to high standards with students, but I also have high expectations from students who work with me.
In general, we should all be responsive, respectful, honest, timely, and hard-working.
When those things aren't happening, we should talk to figure out how we can get there.
Note that the failure---or perceived failure---could be due to my actions as well.
I recognize that this is one of the most important and consequential relationships you will have; while I hope it would be at least as meaningful for me, it is less likely to be as consequential.
As a result, I encourage you to let me know if something is not working.

Importantly, I am your _advisor_; I am not your manager, not your supervisor, not even your teacher.
I am not here to "boss you around" or to tell you what to do when, but I do provide suggestions, recommendations, and sometimes even decisions ("this paper is not good enough to submit for this deadline"), and I do expect to see various outcomes (and progress), but I try to stay away from prescribing the details.
Instead, I will help you set your own plans and goals and the best way to reach them.
Of course, the power dynamics are somewhat tilted in my "favor" and I recognize that: I often fund your work; I sign your thesis; I report to the school on your progress.
Still, I welcome pushback from PhD students (e.g., "I don't think we should run this simulation"), as well as healthy feedback and disagreement.
A relationship where we never disagree is unlikely to be a fruitful one. 
If you are taking agency over your work, you will eventually feel that one of my suggestions is a bad one, and I encourage you to tell me.

I also am not likely to directly teach you many of the specific skills you would need for your research tasks.
I will not teach you Fortran or C++ (or any other language for that matter).
I will not teach you how to launch an ssh session onto one of the university supercomputers.
I _will_ help you get all these skills, though, by pointing you to the right resources when needed (e.g., courses, papers, tutorials, documentation, or knowledgeable others).

#### Power Structures

Of course, the university (like most of society) has strong hierarchical structures.
Professors are in positions of power over students and students are unfortunately not always able to speak up when something isn't right.
I welcome student input, especially if I or one of my colleagues has said or done something that makes a student feel uncomfortable.
I do realize that it is a difficult proposition in many cases, especially if you feel I am the culprit.
If you feel you suffered harassment, intolerance, or other injustices I encourage you to speak to me or other trusted individuals.

#### Co-Advising

I am a big fan of co-advising PhD students, and some of my students have been co-advised.
As long as the "trio" dynamics are healthy, including the relationship between the two advisors, this is a good idea: gives you another smart person to advise you and be invested in your future; broadens the set of ideas and knowledge you are exposed to.
There are potential drawbacks, some overhead for you (scheduling, more weekly and lab meetings), potential friction when advisors disagree.
But overall, if there are two faculty members whose work, vision, and interests align with yours, you should definitely explore co-advising.

#### Time with Me and Others

I try to make myself available to my PhD students as my first priority in terms of both calendar and attention.
Having said that, there are sometimes other requirements on my time, often immutable and sometimes urgent.
You should expect to be able to see me often or get fairly rapid responses, but do not expect to see me or be able to get my time and attention "on demand."
You are always welcome to try though!

Most importantly, we will have a 45-60 minutes long weekly one-on-one meeting slot in which we will talk about your work and progress, brainstorm ideas, and generally touch on any matter you want to discuss.
You can also ask for my time at any other point, e.g., for a quick ad-hoc meeting, which I will be happy to do whenever possible.

Beyond the 1-1 meeting, you will be asked to attend the weekly lab meeting where students share progress as well as other updates.
You may also see me in project-specific meetings (frequency depends on the project) where we are working with other collaborators.

#### How to get a hold of me

If I'm not there in person at work, you can try to find me in multiple ways.
First, Slack.
In particular, our lab's Slack team is the best way to find me.
I am also of course available by email.
However, email is not a synchronous medium, and I often turn it off in order to get stuff done, and stuff tends to get lost there due to volume.

If you need me to meet with you at a certain time, it's best to contact me about it first, then when I've agreed to the time, send me a calendar invitation (this is true for everyone else you'd like to have a meeting with in professional settings).

If you want me to be responsive to you, you should be responsive to me.
However, I do not expect you to be responsive during non-working hours (unless we agreed to be  working on a deadline).
