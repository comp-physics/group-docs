### The Where and When of Working

One of the biggest challenges in your PhD is time management.
I will help you set long-term and short-term goals, but will never directly manage your time or your tasks.
As a result, you will be the prime owner of your time and schedule -- for better or worse!

I highly recommend that you structure your time in some way that works for you.
For example, I believe that it will be helpful to you to work on research everyday: structures and routines can help you accomplish that, rather than frenzied effort right before deadlines.

[Eric's syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11D3kHElzS2HQxTwPqcaTnU5HCJ8WGE5brTXI4KLf4dM/edit#) has some helpful tips for managing your time and schedule.
At a high level, you should have a set of daily tasks, but also some higher level (weeks, month, semester, year) goals.
I will help you set those, typically going to larger and larger time frames as your PhD advances.
For time and task management, use whatever tool works for you: notebooks, task manager apps, text files, ...
but make sure to use _something_.

#### Work location

Cornell Tech has an open space layout where my students and I sit next to each other. You will have an assigned desk in that space. I spend most of my time in that space, or in my meeting huddle (a few steps away), or in other meetings. I expect most students to be working from that space regularly, which is not to say "most of the time" but perhaps a substantial portion of the working hours each week  in that space. Most of the students come in at least 3 days a week. Frankly, if work and progress gets done I don't mind where you are. But I find that progress and problem solving are more likely when you are surrounded by others (including me) who can help solve problems, answer questions, and point you in a helpful direction. This is in addition to providing an environment that helps you focus on work.  It's often the case that students vary their physical presence, e.g. when they have a writing task that requires focus not offered in a more busy environment. That's totally acceptable, but you are expected to let the team (me, your collaborators) know when they should expect you.

Oh and if you find it hard to concentrate in the open space, we are happy to sponsor noise-cancelling headphones.


### The When of _Not_ Working

You do not need to work all the time to be a successful researcher. In fact, I think the current evidence suggests (and I strongly believe) that working all the time is counterproductive. Nevertheless, you may encounter a culture in academia of always-working; I recommend that you resist this.

The hardest thing about academic time off is ownership. When you are off, it is your research that does not advance. This is hard to contend with. But what is often left out is (a) that you are more productive and motivated in your working time when you have a good balance with your time off (b) that time off is critical for new insights, ideas, and reflections that are not otherwise available.

I recommend thinking about your PhD as work, with a work schedule (hopefully a "normal" one, i.e. weekdays) and time off work, even if you have to force yourself to do so.  Please take care of yourself, in whatever way you need to that is meaningful to you, on a daily basis. For example, I will often take long multiple-weeks (or more) vacations, especially over the semester breaks.

#### Vacations

There are specific guidelines provided by Cornell, but Ph.D. students in my group should feel free to spend up to 6 weeks every year on various breaks and vacations. I strongly encourage that you take at least 4 weeks off. (If I could insist that you take at least 4 weeks, I would; if you need more than 6 weeks, well, frankly nobody is really counting but you still need to make progress). Vacation means _vacation_: no work email (or just monitoring for urgent needs), no working on papers, no analyzing data. Note that conference travel does not (and should not) count as vacation. You can also take leave, for example during summer if you are not funded (see note on internships below). I took the second summer of my PhD off to travel the world for three months.

What works best for vacation is scheduling time off well in advance. "Taking off next week" is never easy -- you will have obligations, meetings, tasks. Planning a vacation six months away is easier, and you can plan around it as the time approaches (to make sure you have no meetings or pressing deadlines, for example).

Any ad-hoc days off you want to take are usually not a problem. Especially after big deadlines, I highly recommend taking a few days off to rest, reflect, and re-energize. When you want to take a longer break like a vacation, it can be helpful to give me a few weeks notice, but Iâ€™m usually flexible.  The most important thing is to communicate your availability in advance. Things outside of work also come up related to health, family, emergencies, etc. Those often require work breaks, and at the very least, different work arrangements. You can let me know if that comes up for you.

Your breaks are not necessarily tied to the academic calendar, nor does "academic break" automatically mean you should treat this time as time off your work and research. It is useful to take time off during academic breaks (often that's when I will be gone) and official university holidays. During my PhD I often traveled just past Christmas and until just before the semester started, mostly to save on airline costs. Of course, if you are taking courses or serving as a TA you should expect to need to be available during the semester.
