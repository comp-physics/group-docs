### Writing papers

**Companion document: [Formatting your papers](formatting.md)**

There are many forms of scholarly impact.
Writing papers is one of themâ€”and among the most important for graduate students.
Though other forms of impact are very important, such as making important systems or helping to inform policy, the importance of such forms often relies on a base of academic writing.

I recommend finding exemplary papers from the target venue to use as referral and inspiration.
Indeed, while you can and will work with me directly on papers (as I expand on below), my time will always be limited; and there is no substitute for interactively thinking about your writing in comparison with other similar scholarship.

#### Process: writing alone, better together

Part of your development as a scholar is being able to plan, outline, and write an academic paper.
I will be your co-author and collaborator for most of the papers you'd write.
As an advisor, I will train you to write academic papers during this co-authorship.

Commonly, we will plan the paper together, thinking about its contributions, how to present then, the intended structure of the paper, how to present the results.
I typically ask my PhD students to write the first draft of each section in the paper independently.

For a 1st or 2nd year student, the writing process might be the student delivering an individual section for in-depth feedback from me, followed by rewrites by the students, ultimately followed by extensive editing and rewriting by me.
For a 5th year student, students (after discussing their thoughts on its direction and narrative) are likely to go off and write a near-perfect paper on their own, followed by collaborative editing and rewriting.

#### Conference Paper Deadlines

Conference papers and abstracts will have deadlines.
I will do whatever I can to help you set appropriate deadlines and meet these deadlines, in terms of planning and in terms of writing.
I highly recommend planning submissions in a way that does not offset or suspend other life goals or practices like sleep.

With advance planning, I am willing to work extra hours before a deadline, recognizing that they are important to advance your career.
You don't have to do that.
However, students can only expect me to work extra hours on a paper deadline if they are also committed to doing so; and should not expect me to work over time to give them feedback unless they verified in advance that I am available and willing to do so (no "hey I just finished the first draft of the paper that's due tomorrow can you read it tonight").

I have an informal "-7 days" internal deadline for submissions.
This guideline states that a paper intended for submission needs to be in submittable (but not perfect) state 7 days before the deadline.
The paper doesn't have to be perfect: the bar I use is that all the sections, results should be there: the studies have to be completed, the data analyzed, the findings solidified, the message of the paper needs to exist, etc.
The paper would often undergo significant changes in that last week, and we may end up working on it extensively as the final deadline approaches, but the -7 days practices should make the deadline more manageable, and the final product (the paper) stronger.

#### Co-authorship

As is common in our field, I am very likely to be a co-author on the papers we work on, which generally means most if not all the papers you lead.
Further, papers (and projects) often involve other collaborators, including faculty, PhD students, MS/undergraduate students and others.

Authorship order will become important, and the default expectation is that you will be listed as first author for your "PhD papers".
However, there are often other considerations for authorship order and first-author choice (e.g., an undergraduate who contributed significantly; a PhD student you collaborated with equally) where you may end up not being a first author even for work that contributes to your PhD.
This is not a problem.

#### Conference and Other Presentations

With many of our papers submitted to highly peer-reviewed conferences, you can expect to be able to present your research in conferences (and similar settings), often to dozens if not hundreds of people.
Later in your PhD you are also likely to have other presentations of your research work, including seminars and eventually job talks.
I will help you prepare for these talks, taking an iterative process that follows in many ways the paper-writing process outlined above: planning/outlining, drafts, iterations.
Expect more of this feedback and iteration earlier in your PhD; it is not uncommon for students to give 3-5 practice versions of the talk before their public presentation, at least in their early years.

Relatedly, I am also likely to present your research in invited talks, lectures and seminars.
I will of course give you prominent credit when I do so.

#### The "-7 days" internal deadline

I have a "-7 days" internal deadline.
The paper needs to be in submittable (but not perfect) state 7 days before the deadline.
If there isn't an official deadline (i.e., we're submitting to a journal with completely rolling submissions), then this rule would apply to whatever day we agreed upon submitting the work.
This is somewhat contrary to the way academics often work in our area, where they're madly writing up to the second before the submission deadline; I don't do that with my students.

That means that everything needs to be essentially done by 7 days before the deadline: the studies have to be completed, the data analyzed, the findings solidified, the message of the paper needs to exist, etc.
This allows me to really understand what we have, where we're at, and where we need to go in the next 7 days.
