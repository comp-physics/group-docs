The new developments in this paper include the construction of optimal explicit SSP linear Runge-Kutta methods, their application to the strong stability of coercive approximations, a systematic study of explicit SSP multistep methods for nonlinear problems, and the study of the SSP property of implicit Runge-Kutta and multistep methods.},

@article{Bryngelson2020,
abstract = {Phase-averaged dilute bubbly flow models require high-order statistical moments of the bubble population. The method of classes, which directly evolve bins of bubbles in the probability space, are accurate but computationally expensive. Moment-based methods based upon a Gaussian closure present an opportunity to accelerate this approach, particularly when the bubble size distributions are broad (polydisperse). For linear bubble dynamics a Gaussian closure is exact, but for bubbles undergoing large and nonlinear oscillations, it results in a large error from misrepresented higher-order moments. Long short-term memory recurrent neural networks, trained on Monte Carlo truth data, are proposed to improve these model predictions. The networks are used to correct the low-order moment evolution equations and improve prediction of higher-order moments based upon the low-order ones. Results show that the networks can reduce model errors to less than 1{\%} of their unaugmented values.},

@article{Nguyen2016,
abstract = {The accurate description and robust simulation, at relatively low cost, of global quantities (e.g. number density or volume fraction) as well as the size distribution of a population of fine particles in a carrier fluid is still a major challenge for many applications. For this purpose, two types of methods are investigated for solving the population balance equation with aggregation, continuous particle size change (growth and size reduction), and nucleation: the extended quadrature method of moments (EQMOM) based on the work of Yuan et al. [52] and a hybrid method (TSM) between the sectional and moment methods, considering two moments per section based on the work of Laurent et al. [30]. For both methods, the closure employs a continuous reconstruction of the number density function of the particles from its moments, thus allowing evaluation of all the unclosed terms in the moment equations, including the negative flux due to the disappearance of particles. Here, new robust and efficient algorithms are developed for this reconstruction step and two kinds of reconstruction are tested for each method. Moreover, robust and accurate numerical methods are developed, ensuring the realizability of the moments. The robustness is ensured with efficient and tractable algorithms despite the numerous couplings and various algebraic constraints thanks to a tailored overall strategy. EQMOM and TSM are compared to a sectional method for various simple but relevant test cases, showing their ability to describe accurately the fine-particle population with a much lower number of variables. These results demonstrate the efficiency of the modeling and numerical choices, and their potential for the simulation of real-world applications.},

@article{Buffo2013,
abstract = {The Conditional Quadrature Method of Moments (CQMOM) and the Direct Quadrature Method of Moments (DQMOM) are compared with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) for the description of gas bubble coalescence, breakage and mass transfer with the surrounding continuous liquid phase. CQMOM and DQMOM are both moment methods based on the idea of overcoming the closure problem by using a quadrature approximation. The methods are compared and performances evaluated for spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. Eventually CQMOM and DQMOM are implemented in a commercial CFD code to simulate a realistic two-dimensional bubble column. Particular attention is paid to the impossibility of conserving moments with DQMOM in the presence of numerical diffusion. To cure this problem a fully-conservative DQMOM formulation is presented and tested. The relationship between the two methods is investigated, showing that under particular conditions CQMOM is identical to DQMOM. The different methods are employed under a number of different conditions including very fast chemical reactions, in order to highlight if the problem of bubble coalescence, breakage and mass transfer really needs a bivariate population balance to be tackled and what is the optimal number of nodes for the quadrature approximation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},
